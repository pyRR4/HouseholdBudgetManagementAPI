#API for Household Budget Management

**Status**: 🚧 *Work in Progress*  
> *Please note: This project is still under development. As of now, only basic CRUD operations for transactions have been implemented.*


##Overview
This project is a simple financial management API that allows users to manage their personal finances by recording transactions, monitoring savings goals, and generating monthly reports. It is built using Spring Boot, with Spring Security (JWT) for authentication, Hibernate (ORM) for data persistence, and MySQL/PostgreSQL as the database. The API will eventually support the following functionalities:

* Managing transactions (CRUD operations for expenses and income)
* Categorizing transactions (food, transport, entertainment, etc.)
* Generating monthly financial reports
* Setting and monitoring savings goals
* User authentication and authorization with JWT
* Secure access to user-specific data
