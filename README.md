# API for Household Budget Management

**Status**: ðŸš§ *Work in Progress*  
> *Please note: This project is still under development. As of now, only basic CRUD operations for transactions, users and categories have been implemented.*




## Overview
This project is a simple financial management API that allows users to manage their personal finances by recording transactions, monitoring savings goals, and generating monthly reports. It is built using Spring Boot, with Spring Security (JWT) for authentication, Hibernate (ORM) for data persistence, and PostgreSQL as the database. The API will eventually support the following functionalities:

* Managing daily transactions
* Categorizing transactions (food, transport, entertainment, etc.)
* Generating monthly financial reports
* Setting and monitoring savings goals
* User authentication
* Secure access to user-specific data
